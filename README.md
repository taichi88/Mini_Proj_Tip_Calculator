this is my very first code and it includes mathematical operations

In this code I ullustrate the simple case which happens mostly eveytime when you are with your friends in restaurant and this program solves it very easily, for example: 
If the bill was $150.00, and there were 5 people and you want to tip 12% to waiter the code makes this calculation:
  - 150$ will be split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
  - Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
  - Round the result to 2 decimal places.

Thanks
